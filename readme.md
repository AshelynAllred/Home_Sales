## Summary/Blurb
UTSA/U2 Data Analytics Bootcamp challenge: Using PySpark to analyze home sales data, and running benchmarks across different storage schemes including uncached, cached, and parquet-partitioned tables.  

## Where is everything?

Everything is located in the main directory. Analysis is inside of the `Home_Sales.ipynb` notebook.

## Work Credit
Aside from the timer functions pre-filled as starter code, plus imports and housekeeping setup, all analysis work here is my own. Online search was was used for a refresher on PySpark method names and use cases, but that's it.

## Images
Images were generated with Google Gemini.  
Prompts:
* "could you give me an image with a transparent background, a few floating file folders and a bunch of question marks?"
    * (none of the generated images had actually transparent backgrounds, and had .jpg file extensions)
* "Make me an image of ethereal suburban houses floating through cyberspace, dissolving into green ones and zeroes that form a stream cutting across the center"
